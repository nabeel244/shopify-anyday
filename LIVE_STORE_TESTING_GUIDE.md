# üè™ Live Shopify Store Testing Guide

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Process to Test on Your Client's Live Store**

### **Step 1: Get Your Client's Store Information**

**You need:**
- Client's store domain (e.g., `client-store.myshopify.com`)
- Client's admin access (or they need to install the app)

### **Step 2: Update App Configuration**

**Replace in the installation URL:**
- `your-client-store` ‚Üí `client-store` (their actual store domain)
- `https://your-app-url.com` ‚Üí Your actual app URL (you'll get this from Shopify Partners)

### **Step 3: Generate Installation URL**

**For your client's store, use this URL format:**
```
https://CLIENT-STORE-DOMAIN.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/authorize?client_id=83d8bbef5c1e5717eba7bb0fd1252451&scope=write_products,read_products,read_orders,write_orders&redirect_uri=YOUR-APP-URL&state=booking-app-install
```

**Example:**
```
https://myclientstore.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/authorize?client_id=83d8bbef5c1e5717eba7bb0fd1252451&scope=write_products,read_products,read_orders,write_orders&redirect_uri=https://your-app-url.com/api/auth&state=booking-app-install
```

### **Step 4: Install App on Client's Store**

**Process:**
1. **Send installation URL to your client**
2. **Client clicks the URL**
3. **Client authorizes the app**
4. **App gets installed in their admin panel**

### **Step 5: Access the Booking System**

**After installation, your client can access:**
- **Admin Panel**: `https://CLIENT-STORE.myshopify.com/admin/apps`
- **Booking Dashboard**: Look for "booking-app-google-sheet" in the apps list

### **Phase 1: Admin Panel Testing**

**1. Access Admin Dashboard**
- Go to client's Shopify admin
- Navigate to Apps ‚Üí Find "booking-app-google-sheet"
- Click to open the booking system

### **Phase 2: Product Page Integration**

**Method 1: Theme Integration (Recommended)**
```liquid
<!-- Add this to your client's product.liquid template -->
<div id="booking-widget-container" style="margin: 20px 0; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px;">
  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Book This Service</h3>
  <div id="booking-widget"></div>
</div>

<script>
// Load the booking widget
fetch('/app/booking-widget?productId={{ product.id }}&title={{ product.title }}&price={{ product.price }}')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(html => {
    document.getElementById('booking-widget').innerHTML = html;
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error loading booking widget:', error);
    document.getElementById('booking-widget').innerHTML = '<p>Booking widget temporarily unavailable. Please contact us to book this service.</p>';
